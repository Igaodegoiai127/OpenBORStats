You can also make it into a unit and install it as a replacement memory
manager on a per-application basis. (See Below) As long as I've not made
any mistakes, the initialization code makes it replace Borland's MM
automatically. Just make it the first item in your application's Uses
clause. (i.e. in the DPR file).
It won't be quite as efficient this way but if you don't have the source,
you don't have much choice.

It's as thread safe as windows... All it really does is pass the calls on to
windows. There's no intelligence in it at all. Intelligence isn't needed
here as Windows already provides everything you need.
